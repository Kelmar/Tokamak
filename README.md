# Tokamak
A C# graphics engine for games and virtual worlds.

This project is just starting out.  The goal is to provide the basis for doing the basic building blocks of a game engine that can be used in a variety of different ways or not at all.

Much of the code is being inspired by the Torque3D Game Engine, but ported to C#.
